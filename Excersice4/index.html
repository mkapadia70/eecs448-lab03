          RODRICK: (WHISPERING) Greg?
          GREG: (GROGGILY) Mmm.
          - (IN SINGSONG) Greg?
          - What?
          - Greg!
          - Huh? What?
          What are you doing? Get up!
          Mom and Dad have been calling you
          for an hour.
          You're about to be late for
          your first day of middle school.
          What?
          Oh, geez! How did that happen?
          Go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!
          She sent me to get you
          while she waits in the car!
          (EXCLAIMS)
          What are you doing? What's going on?
          Getting ready for...
          (HOOTING)
          ...school.
          Are you insane?
          School doesn't start till next week.
          And, FYI, school doesn't start
          at 4:00 in the morning!
          You woke up Manny.
          And if he doesn't go back down...
          Good morning!
          There is no way he is going back down.
          I just wanted to sleep till 6:00.
          - Bubby!
          - FRANK: Go to bed. I got him.
          Greg, what are you doing up
          making all this noise?
          It was Rodrick! He woke me up!
          He changed my clock!
          (SNORING)
          - But I swear, he was just...
          - Go to bed.
          What is that smell? I can't even identify it.
          Bubby!
          (GRUNTS)
          (GIGGLING)
          KIDS: Happy Birthday!
          Here, Bubby.
          GREG: Wow! Look at the size
          of that flamethrower!
          Okay, first of all,
          let me get something straight.
          This is a journal, not a diary.
          Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.
          But when my mom went out
          to buy this thing,
          I specifically told her
          not to buy one that said "diary" on it.
