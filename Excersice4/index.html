          RODRICK: (WHISPERING) Gregack
GREG: (GROGGILY) Mmm.
- (IN SINGSONG) Greg?
- What?
- Greg!
- Huh? What?
What are you doing? Get up!
Mom and Dad have been calling you
for an hour.
You're about to be late for
your first day of middle school.
What?25
Oh, geez! How did that happen?1000
Go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!
She sent me to get you
while she waits in the car!
(EXCLAIMS)
What are you doing? What's going on?
Getting ready for...
(HOOTING)
...school.
Are you insane?
School doesn't start till next week.
And, FYI, school doesn't start
at 4:00 in the morning!
You woke up Manny.ack
And if he doesn't go back down...
Good morning!
There is no way he is going back down.
I just wanted to sleep till 6:00.
- Bubby!
- FRANK: Go to bed. I got him.
Greg, what are you doing upid="red"
making all this noise?
It was Rodrick! He woke me up!
He changed my clock!
(SNORING)255
- But I swear, he was just...ack
- Go to bed.
What is that smell? I can't even identify it.
Bubby!
(GRUNTS)
(GIGGLING)
KIDS: Happy Birthday!
Here, Bubby.
GREG: Wow! Look at the size
of that flamethrower!
Okay, first of all,id="red"
let me get something stright
This is a journal, not a diary.
Yeah, I know what it says on the cover25
But when my mom went out
to buy this thing,
I specifically told her
not to buy one that said "diary" on it.
This just proves Mom doesn't understand0
anything about kids my age.
- GREG: Huh?
- Sissy!
The only reason I agreed to
write in this thing is because
when I'm rich and famous
I'll have better things to do
than answer people's stupid questions
all day long.
Gregory, tell us about your childhood!
Were you always so smart and handsome?
Here's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.
SUSAN: That's our boy up there.
Why did I ever say no to him?
Mom got me this thing
so I could write down my feelings
about starting middle school.
But I'm gonna be fine.
It's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson,
I'm worried about.255
He's definitely not middle school ready.
Geronimo!
(WHOOPS)
He's not quite clear
on the concept of growing up.ack
I want a puppy, a kitty,
a gumball machine...
But anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.color-bordercolorBorder
I always figured
they'd make a movie about my life.
